    "# **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to address a Residential Energy Management problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is for your agent to control a battery and optimize the electricity costs for a residential household. You will submit your trained agent, which will first be evaluated using an evaluation dataset (different from what you have). Following that, your agent will be deployed in a real-world setting: the [HomeLab](https://idlab.ugent.be/resources/homelab). After deployment, you will receive data detailing the performance of your agent in both environments. Finally, you will write a brief essay analyzing and discussing the results. \\\n",
    "Moreover, we wrote a set of questions / tasks you can fill in the notebook. Each question will contribute to the final grade you will obtain from this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task involves managing energy for a residential household equipped with a Photovoltaic (PV) system and an Energy Storage System (ESS), specifically a battery. In the context of the global shift toward decarbonizing energy sources, these types of challenges are becoming increasingly significant. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be a promising technique for addressing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup includes a household where residents consume electricity daily, resulting in a unique consumption profile. Electricity costs are based on a dynamic price profile, with prices varying by the hour. When the household generates more energy (from the PV system or battery) than it consumes, the excess will be sold back to the grid, although the selling price is typically much lower than the buying price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your objective is to train an RL agent to control the battery and minimize electricity costs. While this might initially seem straightforward (e.g., charge the battery when prices are low and discharge it when prices are high), there are several challenges that complicate the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Uncertainty in household consumption**: Future consumption is difficult to predict. While models based on inhabitants' habits can provide reasonable estimates[1], there is always a stochastic element involved.\n",
    "*   **Variability in PV production**: PV energy generation depends on weather conditions, adding another layer of unpredictability.\n",
    "*   **Dynamic price profiles**: Although, for simplicity, we assume a single price profile repeats daily in this assignment, real-world scenarios often involve prices that vary from day to day.\n",
    "*   **Physical constraints**: The control of the battery and the accuracy of data from the household (such as PV production and overall consumption) are not perfect. While these issues are ignored in the simulation, they will become evident in the real-world results from HomeLab after your agent has been deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, although not considered in this assignment, more complex setups may include assets like heat pumps or electric vehicle chargers. These cases may require an extended RL framework, potentially involving multi-agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the assignment, you will use an agent based on the [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347) algorithm. There are some libraries that have already implemented the algorithm, the most famous being [stable-baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/#). However, in this assignment, you will write the algorithm code yourself. To help you with the task, we provide you with most of the code you will need to develop a PPO agent.\n",

    "In this assignment, we provide the essential code to help you train a PPO agent for a Home Energy Management (HEM) problem. To begin, download the material.zip file available in the course resources. This file contains the necessary code and information to complete the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading, extract the .py files and upload them into the 'Files' section of this Colab notebook. Next, run the code snippet below, which will import all required external libraries, along with the support classes from the files you just uploaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "We advise you **not** to change the code we provided you in such files. Any changes in those files that hinder our evaluation of your agents might result in your submission receiving a lower grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**N.B:** For training the neural networks used in the PPO algorithm, we require that you use the PyTorch library included in the provided files. Using other deep learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow) could cause compatibility issues when evaluating your agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you require additional standard Python packages for your work, feel free to import them in the following cell. (by standard Python packages we consider the ones included in the Google colab environment. Avoid using any 'pip install' call in this notebook) \\\n",
    "In case you want to download the notebook and run it locally, you can recreate the colab environment by installing the same versions in your local machine. The list of packages' versions can be seen through the command `!pip freeze` executed below."

    "Below, you can find the class of the PPO agent you will use in the assignment. First, we ask you to **carefully read the code** and understand it as much as possible. The code misses some parts that you will need to fill in. In particular, you need to complete the following methods:\n",
    "- `train`: Perform `num_iterations` training steps. In each training step, perform `num_batches` rollouts and train both the actor and the critic on the obtained data. In this method, 2 portions needs to be completed. First, you will need to calculate the estimated advantage values `A_k`. For stability reasons, it is good practice to normalize these values by scaling them into a more manageable interval (e.g., ~[-1, 1]); how can you do so? If you do not scale the estimations, what do you notice in your training curve? Then, you need to implement the PPO loss for the actor. For that, it can be handy to use the torch function `torch.clamp`.\n",
    "- `calculate_value_logprobs`: Given the batched states and actions, it returns the estimated values of the batched states (from the critic network) and the logarithmic probabilities of the batched actions in relation to the current actor distribution. Check the documentation of the `MultivariateNormal` class, as it will be quite useful for implementing this function.\n",
    "- `sample_action`: Given the input `state`, it returns the corresponding action from the actor, and the logarithmic probability of the action in relation to the current actor distribution. There is also a boolean input `explore`. If the boolean is set to `True`, the output is an action sampled from the actor probability distribution. Else, if the boolean is set to `False`, the action will be the most likely one from the actor probability distribution. Check the documentation of the `MultivariateNormal` class, as it will be quite useful for implementing this function.\n",
    "- `rollout`: This function perform `num_batches` rollout. Each rollout correspond to the execution of one episode sampling from the actor policy distribution. You can use the `sample_action` method for that. Part of the rollout loop is already provided. You will need to complete it by properly filling the batch lists (`batch_action`, `batch_states`, `batch_rewards`, and `batch_log_probs`) with their corresponding values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important: The agent and critic should be working and training with normalized (i.e., scaled) states, actions, and rewards. Make sure to implement the following code sections accordingly. When evaluating your agent, we will assume your actor neural network takes the normalized state as input and returns the normalized actions. We will normalize the states and de-normalize the actions accordingly to the environment documentation.**"

    "# **Conclusions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have everything you need to start training an effective agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To proceed further, you can change the hyperparameters, write new functions to keep track of the training process, and produce informative graphs that can help you understand what is going on behind the curtains of the model. \\\n",
    "To double check the code you just wrote, try to train and evaluate the agent on a single day (i.e., using the same data of 1 single day for both training and evaluation). This is a very simple task, hence your agent is supposed to behave well without too many difficulties. For example, try with day number 100. With that day, your agent should be able to achieve a daily total reward that is at least greater than -0.4 (when using a 4kW, 8kWh battery). \\\n",
    "Keep in mind that the algorithm will require some time to get trained. Don't give up on a parameter setting after only a bunch of minutes of training. Sometimes the agent might just need some extra episodes of training to start getting some sense of its actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your final agent needs to be saved using the methods we provided you. The agent you will upload will be evaluated on a private dataset taken out of the data we gave you, and the results will influence the score of your assignment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever extra code you think you will need to train the agent, please write it below. \\\n",
    "**Moreover, we prepared a set of questions and tasks for you. These are part of your assignment evaluation.**"
